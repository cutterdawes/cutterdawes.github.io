                I'm Cutter Dawes, a recent Princeton University graduate with a B.A. in Mathematics and a minor in Cognitive Science. My core passion lies in understanding artificial intelligence, particularly through the lens of mechanistic interpretability. My academic journey, including my thesis on the inductive biases of recurrent neural networks (which won two awards and is slated for publication), and my research on local learning in artificial neural networks at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence, has consistently explored the intricacies of both biological and artificial minds. I believe that interpretability, the pursuit of understanding these complex artificial minds, is one of the most crucial problems of our time, and it's a field I'm deeply committed to contributing to.
